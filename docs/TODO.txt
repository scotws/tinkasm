BEFORE BETA:

- Format listing file
- Make sure that A8->16 switch only works in native mode of the 65816
- Rewrite inline codes so that we have them ready for listing
- Complete opcode lists
- Complete documentation 


AFTER RELEASE:

- Allow modifier and math terms in branch instructions
- Add parameters to macros
- Add system macros (if/then/else, loops)
- Add modify & math to assignments
- Analysis step: Suggest JSR, RTS --> JMP
- Add counts for 65816 mode and register size switches
