BEFORE BETA:

- Handle MVP and MVN 
- Addresses are included in inbetween sources (after labels are removed) 
- Listing file only when user requests it
- Format listing file


AFTER RELEASE:

- Add parameters to macros
- Add system macros (if/then/else, loops)

- Analysis step: Suggest JSR, RTS --> JMP
