MANUAL for A Typist's Assembler for the 65816 in Python 
Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>
First version: 24. Sep 2015
This version: 20. Oct 2015



- Requires Python 3.4 or later. Will not run with Python 2.7. 
- Does not distinguish between upper and lower case (internally, all is converted to lower case)



PARAMETERS

-i --input      - Input assembler file (required) 
-o --output     - Output file for the binary code, default is tasm.bin 
-l --listing    - Output file for the listing, default is listing.txt  



NOTES ON CODING STYLE 

Priority for the coding style was to make the program easy to understand -- and thereby also easy to modify and adapt -- for people who might not be familiar with the workings of an assembler. This is why Python was chosen as a language. Speed and compactness of code are secondary; in both these cases, the single-pass assember in Forth (https://github.com/scotws/tasm65816) is probably the better choice. 

In practical terms, what this means is that IF constructs were used even in cases when the result could have been achieved through calculation, because it allows a quicker understanding of the logic involved.
